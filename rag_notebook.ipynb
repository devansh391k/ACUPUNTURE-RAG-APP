      "Based on the provided acupuncture treatment contexts, the key points for treating migraines with acupuncture are:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **ST-8**: This point has been shown to be effective in reducing the frequency and duration of migraine attacks, as well as the number of sick days, in a large prospective, randomized, multi-center, group-comparison trial (Ng et al, Altern Complement Med 2003).\n",
      "2. **G.B.-5**: This point, in combination with ST-8, G.B.-20, Du-14, and LU-7, has been demonstrated to be significantly more effective than conventional drug therapy in reducing migraine attacks and sick days (Liguori et al., J Tradit Chin Med 2000).\n",
      "3. **G.B.-20**: This point, as part of the aforementioned combination, has been shown to be effective in reducing migraine attacks and sick days.\n",
      "4. **Du-14**: This point, as part of the aforementioned combination, has been shown to be effective in reducing migraine attacks and sick days.\n",
      "5. **LU-7**: This point, as part of the aforementioned combination, has been shown to be effective in reducing migraine attacks and sick days.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is essential to note that the efficacy of acupuncture in treating migraines may be independent of the location of the acupuncture points, as suggested by the ART trial (page 722). However, the combination of points mentioned above has been shown to be effective in reducing migraine attacks and sick days.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition, a study by Allais et al (Headache 2002) demonstrated that acupuncture treatment at points including Du-20 resulted in a significant reduction in migraine attacks and analgesic consumption, as well as a decrease in pain intensity, compared to flunarizine treatment.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is recommended that a comprehensive treatment plan be developed in consultation with a licensed acupuncturist, taking into account individual patient needs and medical history.\n"
